# CSS reset

Everyone browser have own fabric style css. This settings can some trouble with displaying my own website. And in this situation we can use CSS reset, which remove all styles included on browser. 

### Elements which we should reset


- margin, padding and border,
- text-underline,
- line-height,
- outline,
- vertical-align.

### Own CSS reset

```css
* {
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
border: 0;
line-height: 1.4em;
vertical-align: baseline;
text-decoration: none;
outline: 0;
}
```

*Unfortunately above style don't work in IE6, because IE6 don't read a "*" *selector.*
